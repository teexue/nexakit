// edit_file / write_file / delete_file run inside the agent loop, which may
// execute tools in parallel (tool_execution.mode = "parallel"). Without this
// guard, two concurrent edits of the same file both read the old content, apply
// their own replacement, and write back — the last writer silently discards
// the other's change (lost update), which corrupts files. The per-path lock
// makes each read→modify→write (or delete) sequence atomic within the process.
